Assignment 6: OpenSSL
Team Member: Dongning Li, Haoge Lin
Environment: 64-bit windows & visual studio 2015
Clarification:
We referred to the course slides and some standard code online to make the program work. 
Because programming in C is a tough job for us since neither of us knows C. 
Now the program is able to be compiled but it is not able to connect to the course forum succesfully.
Given the situation that we're running out of time, so we decide to turn in the program even though we failed to deliver all the function required by the assignment. 
Please try to understand that we've already made our best efforts to make it work. Thank you.

Due the size of project, we only upload the source files without environment setting files.
